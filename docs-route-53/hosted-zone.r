************
    A hosted zone is a container for records, and records contain information about how you want to route traffic
    for a specific domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (acme.example.com, zenith.example.com). A 
    hosted zone and the corresponding domain have the same name. There are two types of hosted zones:
        - Public hosted zones contain records that specify how you want to route traffic on the internet
        - Private hosted zones contain records that specify how you want to route traffic in an Amazon VPC
