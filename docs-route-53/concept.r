Route 53
********
    Amazon Route 53 is a Domain Name System (DNS) service in AWS that is designed to give developers and businesses 
an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names 
like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. 
Route 53 reduces the complexity and operational overhead of DNS management and allows you to focus on building 
your applications instead of managing a complex DNS infrastructure yourself.
